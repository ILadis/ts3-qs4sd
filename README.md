## Building

### Backend

The following dependencies are required to build the TeamSpeak 3 client plugin:
1. [mongoose](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose): for HTTP server/client and web sockets
1. [ts3client-pluginsdk](https://github.com/TeamSpeak-Systems/ts3client-pluginsdk): the TeamSpeak 3 plugin SDK
1. libpulse: to control audio volumes of applications
1. libsqlite3: to inject bookmarks into TeamSpeak 3 settings.db

To download dependencies 1-2 run `make vendor` (this requires `curl`). All other dependencies need to be installed manually. Then run `make` to build the plugin.

Change the working directory to `backend/` before issuing any `make` commands.

### Frontend

The following tools are required to build the DeckyLoader plugin:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): JavaScript runtime required for building
1. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io): package manager for JavaScript/Node.js

After all required tools are installed run the following commands to build the frontend:

```sh
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm run /^build/
```

This should create a `plugin.zip` file containing both the front- and backend part of the plugin.

## Installing

Follow these steps in order to install and setup the plugin on your Steam Deck:
1. Install DeckyLoader on your Steam Deck as described [here](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader).
1. Switch to desktop mode, download TeamSpeak 3 from the Discover store and launch it.
1. Add all TeamSpeak servers you want to connect to as bookmarks (Bookmarks â‡¾ Manage Bookmarks).
1. If you want to use Push-to-Talk allow TeamSpeak to access your Steam Deck inputs:  
   `flatpak override --user com.teamspeak.TeamSpeak3 --device=all`
1. Switch back to gaming mode and install TS3 QuickAccess from the DeckyLoader store.

To install the plugin manually follow steps 1-4 from above and then:

1. Go to DeckyLoader settings and enable developer mode.
