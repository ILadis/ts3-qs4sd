## Building

The following dependencies are required to build the TeamSpeak 3 client plugin:
1. [mjson](https://github.com/cesanta/mjson): for JSON parsing
1. [mongoose](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose): for HTTP server/client and web sockets
1. [incbin](https://github.com/graphitemaster/incbin): for embedding static resources
1. [ts3client-pluginsdk](https://github.com/TeamSpeak-Systems/ts3client-pluginsdk): the TeamSpeak 3 plugin SDK
1. libpulse: to control audio volumes of applications

To download dependencies 1-4 run `make vendor` (this requires `wget`). All other dependencies need to be installed manually. Then run `make` to build the plugin.

Change the working directory to `backend/` before issuing any `make` commands.

## Installing

Follow these steps in order to install and setup the plugin on your Steam Deck:
1. Install DeckyLoader on your SteamDeck as described [here](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader).
1. Switch to desktop mode, download TeamSpeak from the Discover store and launch it.
1. Add all TeamSpeak servers you want to connect to as bookmarks (Bookmarks â‡¾ Manage Bookmarks).
1. If you want to use Push-to-Talk allow TeamSpeak to access your Steam Deck inputs: `flatpak override --user com.teamspeak.TeamSpeak --device=all`
1. Switch back to gaming mode and install TS3 QuickAccess from the DeckyLoader store.

To install the plugin manually follow steps 2-3 from above and then:
